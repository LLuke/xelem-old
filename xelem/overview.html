<H2 id="spreadsheetml">SpreadsheetML</H2>
Understanding the global structure of SpreadsheetML is critical in
using some of the methods of xelem's classes. These methods are often
not documented in this javadoc; a notion of their working should be obtained
by looking up the corresponding documentation on the xml-element.
<br>
An overview of SpreadsheetML, the xml-dialect for Excel, can be obtained
at:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=fe118952-3547-420a-a412-00a2662442d9&amp;displaylang=en">
Office 2003 XML Schemas</a>

<H2 id="xelem">xelem</H2>
The architecture of xelem stays close to the architecture of SpreadsheetML. 
Each element in the xml can have it's equivalent in a Java class that implements the 
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.XLElement XLElement-interface}.
Though for you, the user of this software, these details are often obscured: 
you simply add a 'Cell' to a 'Worksheet' and bypass the underlying structures of 
'Table' and 'Row'. You'd call on a method like freezePanesAt(int row, int column) 
and don't have to bother about the settings of 'Pane'-elements that go with the show. 
Xelem takes care of that.
The root of the XML spreadsheet is the Workbook-element, the hub and starting point
of xelem is the {@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.ss.XLWorkbook XLWorkbook.class}.

<HR>
<H3 id="creatingaworkbook">creating a workbook</H3>
Typically, the {@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.ss.XLWorkbook} 
is at the start of creating an Excel workbook in 
SpreadsheetML. Mostly all of the other objects in xelem can be obtained
from it or through it by one of the addXxx- or getXxx-methods. 
After setting up the workbook, you can obtain the 
{@link org.w3c.dom.Document org.w3c.dom.Document} from it or serialize 
the workbook by means of one of the
serialize-methods in the {@link nl.fountain.xelem.XSerializer XSerializer.class}.
<P>
Here's a small example:
<PRE>
        import nl.fountain.xelem.XSerializer;
        import nl.fountain.xelem.XelemException;
        import nl.fountain.xelem.excel.Workbook;
        import nl.fountain.xelem.excel.ss.XLWorkbook;
               
        public class HelloExcel {
        
            public static void main(String[] args) throws XelemException {
                Workbook wb = new XLWorkbook("HelloExcel");
                wb.addSheet().addCell("Hello Excel!");
                new XSerializer().serialize(wb);
            }
        }
</PRE>
The first line constructs a
new workbook with the name "HelloExcel". The last line 
serializes the workbook, in this
case to a file called "HelloExcel.xls", since we didn't set a filename on the
workbook explicitly. The setting up of the workbook's contents took place
between these lines: here we added a sheet and a cell who's contents read
"Hello Excel!". In a real-world example the setting up of the workbook's contents
and formatting would probably take more lines of code, but would typically be
between the construction and the serialization of the workbook.

<HR>
<H3 id="xlelements">XLElements</H3>
The {@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.XLElement XLElement-interface} is at the heart 
of xelem. Each SpreadsheetML-element can have it's equivalent in a 
Java class that implements this interface. Besides methods for setting attributes
and adding children, instances of these classes are capable of assembling their state 
into an {@link org.w3c.dom.Element} and attach this Element to a parent-element in a
{@link org.w3c.dom.Document}. Assembly of the complete workbook takes place
after a call to the Workbook's 
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.Workbook#createDocument() createDocument}-method, wich
is called by the {@link nl.fountain.xelem.XSerializer XSerializer.class}, before
serializaton.
<P>
Most instances of XLElements can be obtained through one of the addXxx- or
getXxx-methods; some of them are dealt with behind the scenes by xelem.
A concatenation of such add's and get's can be legal code:
<PRE>
        sheet.getTable().addColumn(3).setStyleID("blue");
</PRE>
XLElements are unaware of their parent until the time of creation of the
Document. This makes it possible to apply the same instance at different
places:
<PRE>
        Worksheet sheet = workbook.addSheet();
        Cell cell = sheet.addCellAt(11, 2); // adds a cell at row 11, column 2
        cell.setStyleID("currency");
        cell.setFormula("=SUBTOTAL(9;R[-10]C:R[-1]C)");
        for (int i = 3; i &lt; 9; i++) {
            sheet.addCell(cell);
        }
</PRE>
The preceding code-stub configures a cell at row 11, column 2, sets a style
and a relative formula, and this cell is distributed in row 11, over columns
3 through 8 inclusive.

<HR>
<H3 id="xfactory">the XFactory</H3>
The {@link nl.fountain.xelem.XFactory} is an intermediary to the configuration file, 
it's main productline being SpreadsheetML Style elements. Normally this class expects 
a configuration file at the location <code>config/xelem.xml</code>, relative to 
the classloader of the main application. If desired a different location may be 
set by calling the static
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.XFactory#setConfigurationFileName(String)}.
<P>
<B>What's in the configuration file?</B> 
<br>Comments and styles up to this far.
<P>
<B>When is the XFactory employed?</B> 
<BR>The workbook uses an instance of
XFactory during the creation of the document and delegates the merging of styles
to it when you call mergeStyles on the workbook.
<P>
<B>What happens if the configuration file is not found or is corrupt?</B>
<BR>Nothing serious. The XFactory will throw Exceptions under these circumstances,
but -since they're not fatal errors- the workbook will catch them and register these
exceptions as warnings. You should allways check if there are any warnings
after creating a document or passing the workbook to the XSerializer.
See {@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.Workbook#getWarnings()}.
<P>
<B>What's an <code>&lt;f:comment&gt;</code>?</B>
<BR>
An <code>&lt;f:comment&gt;</code> is an element in the configuration file and
is most confusingly known in these java-interfaces as a docComment.
DocComments are the comments that will be passed in at the start of 
the Workbook document, just after the processing instruction.
<P>
<B>What about Styles?</B>
<BR>
Read all about Styles in the <a href="#styles">next chapter</a>.
<P>
<B>Where can I find an example of a configuration file?</B>
<BR>
An example of the configuration file is included in the distribution of this
library and can be found at <code>../lib/config/xelem.xml</code>. Here's an 
another example:
<PRE>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
    &lt;Xelem 	xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet"
    		xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"
    		xmlns:x="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel"
    		xmlns:ss="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet"
    		xmlns:f="urn:schemas-fountain-nl:xelem:config"
    		xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"&gt;
    		
      &lt;f:comment&gt;      THIS IS AN EXCEL-FILE OF TYPE SpreadsheetML.        &lt;/f:comment&gt;
      &lt;f:comment&gt;                   IF YOU READ THIS                       &lt;/f:comment&gt;
      &lt;f:comment&gt;    YOU PROBABLY NEED A MORE RECENT VERSION OF EXCEL.     &lt;/f:comment&gt;
      
      &lt;Styles&gt;
      
        &lt;Style ss:ID="Default" ss:Name="Normal"&gt;
          &lt;Alignment ss:Vertical="Bottom"/&gt;
          &lt;Borders/&gt;
          &lt;Font/&gt;
          &lt;Interior/&gt;
          &lt;NumberFormat/&gt;
          &lt;Protection/&gt;
        &lt;/Style&gt;
        
        &lt;Style ss:ID="blue"&gt;
          &lt;Interior ss:Color="#0000FF" ss:Pattern="Solid"/&gt;
        &lt;/Style&gt;
        
      &lt;/Styles&gt;
    
    &lt;/Xelem&gt;
</PRE>

<HR>
<H3 id="styles">Styles</H3>
A 'Style' is a SpreadsheetML-element, but it does not have an equivalent in a
java-class in xelem (yet). It's more practical to have the definition of
used styles in a file: the configuration file (see above). This way you can
use your Excel-application to create styles wysiwyg-like and copy them to 
the mentioned file. You should not include a prefix on the Style-element nor it's
children, though the attributes should have prefixes. Styles should not have
an attribute 'ss:ParentID', xelem cannot handle these correctly.
<P>
Cells, Rows, Columns and Tables all have a method setStyleID(String id). When you
use these methods, you should either have a definition with the same
ss:ID-attribute as the passed id in the configuration
file or you should have merged a style with such an id before calling the
createDocument-method on the workbook. 

<HR>
<H3 id="webapplications">xelem and webApplications</H3>
Using xelem in a webApplication can offer your clients the oppertunity to
download Excel-files that are dynamically created upon request. Here's an example
of a Servlet-method that responds to a request for download:
<PRE>
        protected void sendWorkbook(HttpServletResponse response, Workbook wb) 
        	throws IOException {
        	
            wb.setFileName(wb.getName() + "_" + ++excelCounter + ".xls");
            response.setContentType("application/vnd.ms-excel");
            response.addHeader("Content-Disposition", 
                    "attachment; filename=" + wb.getFileName());
            
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
            try {
                new XSerializer().serialize(wb, out);
                out.flush();
            } catch (XelemException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                out.close();
            }
        }
</PRE>
Now the first line of code may be puzzling. The <code>excelCounter</code> is
a static int that is increased by 1, each time an xml workbook-file is send
over the line. But why is it there? Ever seen the message "A file with the
name 'foo.xls' is allready open"? That's why. 
<br>Immagine your webApplication
serves Excel-files for download entitled "Volume of Business.xls".
Your CEO sets some parameters on a form and downloads the
"Volume of Business.xls" for Europe for the passed month. She wants to
know more, returns to your site, changes some parameters and expects
to download the "Volume of Business.xls", this time for the US and for the past year.
Now she's in trouble: Excel won't open a second file with the same name.
<br>Here's where the 
<code>excelCounter</code> comes in. With the line of code the 
first downloaded file would have been named
"Volume of Business_303.xls" or something and the second one 
"Volume of Business_305.xls". Never a double name and never a problem.
<P>
Allthough the produced xml contains a processing-instruction, some browsers
only look at the extension when deciding what to do with a downloaded file.
My Mozilla browser is effectively (mis)lead by the extension '.xls' and
suggests to use Excel as the application to open the downloaded file.
<P>
The <code>setContentType</code>- and <code>addHeader</code>-lines
serve equally to guarantee the correct transfer of the file.
The rest of the code is clear enough.
