Provides classes that enable reading SpreadsheetML.
<P>
The basic class for reading xml-spreadsheets of type spreadsheetML is
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReader}. 
It can deliver the contents of an xml-file or an 
xml-InputSource as a fully populated {@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.Workbook}.
This package also offers an event-based model with the
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReaderListener ExcelReaderListener-interface} 
which can be fine-tuned with an {@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReaderFilter} 
that acts as a wrapper for listeners.

Suppose you want to do something. Well rather, suppose you have an Excel-file
and you want to do something with it's contents and structure in Java. Here's
what you got to do:
<PRE>
   ExcelReader reader = new ExcelReader();
   Workbook xlWorkbook = reader.getWorkbook("foo/bar/myFile.xml");
</PRE>
Now what you have is a fully populated 
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.ss.XLWorkbook}, that is, the complete representation
of the Excel xml-file <code>myFile.xml</code> in Java class-instances. Now you can
inspect it's structure, process it's contents, alter it or send it to the president.
<P>
OOoops! You got an <code><font color="red">
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
</font></code>, did ya? The thing is that the above code works fine as long as
your workbooks aren't too big. Every cell, row, worksheet and so on in the file
that you're reading is stuffed as an object into the one encompassing object
XLWorkbook. How much will go in there depends -among others- on your system
and VM-settings. So what if you want to read large files and huge input sources?
